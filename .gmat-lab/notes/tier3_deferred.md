# Tier 3 Deferred (By Design)

These items are not being implemented now. They require dedicated validation
campaigns, standards interpretation, or specialized modeling frameworks beyond
core GMAT + free public data pipelines.

## Deferred items

- Formal NASA-STD-8719.14 hazard reporting compliance pipeline
- Kessler cascade and debris population evolution model verification
- Standards-grade collision probability framework with covariance rigor
- Full network-topology analytics stack (Hodge Laplacian/spectral) as mission authority

## Why deferred

- High validation burden: correctness requires domain review, not just execution.
- Certification risk: outputs can be used for safety-critical decisions.
- Model-governance risk: assumptions and calibration must be explicitly audited.

## Activation condition

Implement only when a stakeholder explicitly requests validation-grade outputs
and commits to model-review sign-off criteria.
